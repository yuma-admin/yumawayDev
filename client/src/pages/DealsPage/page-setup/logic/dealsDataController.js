// THIS FUNCTION DETERMINES STATE SELECTED AND SETS PAGE DATA AND IMAGE URLS
// HOW IT WORKS
// --- It reads the URL HREF (colorado-deals or michigan-deals)
// --- It then sets appropriate data for images and the state selector
// --- It builds this data into data objects that can be accessed through object notation on the deals page
// --- Currently, this data is then set as state on the Deals page

// IMAGES
//  --- Images are located in folders at root/client/public/images/
//  --- Image URLS are specified in the file paths imported at the top of this page
//  --- Image sizes/specs are specified in each file to inform designer
//  --- Image URLS must match an image name in the folder, or this page will break

// WEEKLY COUPONS
//  --- weeklyDealsData will be updated every Wednesday night
//  --- The images are located at root/client/public/images/deals/
//  --- After replacing above, make sure they match URLS in weeklyDealsData
//  - I recommend maintaining the name structure "coupon-1, coupon-2, etc." for easy changing, but you can do as you like
